### 1) Product First, Always
- Superior product performance is the foundation; advertising can only accelerate what people already find genuinely valuable.
- “The best way to increase the sale of a product is to improve the product.” • “The key to successful marketing is superior product performance.…If the consumer does not perceive any real benefits in the brand, then no amount of ingenious advertising and selling can save it.”

### 2) Homework Before Headlines
- Know more than anyone about the product, the market, and the competition; insight precedes imagination.
- “First, study the product you are going to advertise. The more you know about it, the more likely you are to come up with a big idea for selling it.” • “What distinguishes the great surgeon is that he knows more than other surgeons. It is the same with advertising agents. The good ones know more.”

### 3) Hunt the Big Idea
- Only a big, relevant, long-lived idea will win attention and drive action; otherwise your ad slips by unnoticed.
- “It takes a big idea to attract the attention of consumers and get them to buy your product.” • “Unless your advertising contains a big idea, it will pass like a ship in the night.”

### 4) Build Enduring Brand Image
- Every execution must add to a clear, consistent brand personality that people choose as much for its image as for its function.
- “Every advertisement should be thought of as a contribution to the brand image.” • “The brand image is 90 per cent of what the distiller has to sell.”

### 5) Headlines Do the Heavy Lifting
- Headlines carry most of the selling power; promise a benefit, deliver news, or offer a service right up top.
- “On the average, five times as many people read the headlines as read the body copy.” • “The headlines which work best are those which promise the reader a benefit.”

### 6) Be Simple. Be Clear.
- Cut complexity; use plain words, short sentences, and crystal-clear demonstrations so no one can misunderstand you.
- “Most campaigns are too complicated… By attempting to cover too many things, they achieve nothing.” • “If you want to avoid your television commercials being misunderstood, you had better make them crystal clear.”

### 7) Test, Then Scale
- Treat advertising as a laboratory: test promises, prices, formats, and media; keep and repeat what works, discard what doesn’t.
- “Experienced practitioners always test some variables…” • “If you are lucky enough to write a good advertisement, repeat it until it stops selling.”

### 8) Sell, Don’t Entertain
- Creativity is only creative if it sells; apply direct-response rigor to all advertising.
- “What is a good advertisement? …an advertisement which sells the most.” • “The Benton & Bowles agency holds that ‘if it doesn’t sell, it isn’t creative.’”

### 9) Differentiate with Meaning
- There is no commodity; position on a distinctive, persuasive promise—quality, value, or service—and make it unmistakable.
- “Professor Levitt, ‘there is no such thing as a commodity. All goods and services are differentiable.’” • “Try to find a promise which is not only persuasive, but also unique.”

### 10) Respect the Consumer
- Speak truth, give facts, show price, and treat people with intelligence and respect; credibility compounds.
- “The consumer is not a moron, she is your wife.” • “The more facts you tell, the more you sell.”
