### FP1 — Start with a must‑have product and a clear promise
- Description: Marketing cannot compensate for a product people don’t truly want. Build or refine until the core value is obvious, then articulate a specific, customer-important promise the product reliably delivers.
- Source Books: Hacking Growth by Sean Ellis and Morgan Brown, Growth Hacker Marketing — Ryan Holiday, Ogilvy on Advertising by David Ogilvy
- Example: Slack pivoted from the failed game Glitch to a must‑have team messaging tool and led with the plainspoken strapline “Be less busy,” a clear promise that resonated with early adopters and enterprises alike. ([marketingweek.com](https://www.marketingweek.com/disruptive-brands/slack/?utm_source=openai))

### FP2 — Make the customer’s outcome the North Star
- Description: Define a single, ambitious goal and metric that represent the customer outcome you exist to create; align revenue and tactics to serve that outcome and reject efforts that trade it off.
- Source Books: Click Here by Alex Schultz, Converted by Neil Hoyne, Everybody Writes — Ann Handley
- Example: Airbnb organizes around “Nights and Experiences Booked” as a central metric, reporting it prominently in shareholder letters and aligning teams on improving guest/host outcomes that drive this measure.

### FP3 — Prove incrementality and optimize for lifetime value
- Description: Judge marketing by incremental impact and long-term customer value, not by activity or short-term transactions; spend more where you can prove true lift and higher lifetime value.
- Source Books: Click Here by Alex Schultz, Converted by Neil Hoyne
- Example: After cutting performance marketing in 2020, Airbnb saw traffic rebound to ~95% of prior levels, then permanently shifted spend toward brand and higher‑return channels—an explicit bet on incremental impact and LTV.

- Source Books: Monetizing Innovation by Madhavan Ramanujam, Georg Tacke
- Example: Superhuman used Van Westendorp willingness‑to‑pay surveys (inspired by Monetizing Innovation) to set premium pricing around $30/month and reinforce a “premium email” positioning.

- Example: Facebook famously focused activation on helping new users add “7 friends in 10 days,” a simple rule that accelerated the first meaningful value moment and predicted retention. ([ma.tt](https://ma.tt/2016/03/chamath-on-growing-facebook/))

### FP7 — Retention is the business model
- Description: Shift the finish line from acquisition to durable retention; identify the moment customers become long-term (‘Retention Point’/stored value) and engineer the journey to reach it sooner.

- Example: Microsoft’s Bing runs hundreds of concurrent controlled experiments daily—embedding trustworthy A/B testing to speed decisions and compound ROI. ([blogs.bing.com](https://blogs.bing.com/search-quality-insights/August-2013/Large-Scale-Experimentation-at-Bing?utm_source=openai))

### FP10 — Attention is scarce: earn it with strong hooks and immediate relevance
- Description: Win the first seconds with a distinctive, concise hook that sets a clear expectation and ties to an outcome the audience wants; package for the platform (titles, thumbnails, pacing).
- Source Books: Hook Point by Brendan Kane, Ogilvy on Advertising by David Ogilvy
- Example: Coinbase’s 60‑second Super Bowl spot was just a bouncing QR code; it drew huge instant engagement and even crashed the site from traffic spikes. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_commercials?utm_source=openai))

### FP11 — Build growth into the product (ethically)
- Description: Make sharing and referral a valuable, easy part of the experience using honest incentives and habit-forming triggers; avoid dark patterns; focus on viral loop quality over spam.
- Source Books: Hacking Growth by Sean Ellis and Morgan Brown, Growth Hacker Marketing — Ryan Holiday
- Example: Dropbox’s built‑in, two‑sided referral program permanently lifted sign‑ups and generated millions of invites per month—textbook product‑embedded growth. ([startup-marketing.com](https://www.startup-marketing.com/dropbox-the-model-%E2%80%9Cvalue-based%E2%80%9D-startup/?utm_source=openai))

### FP12 — Focus beats spread: concentrate on high‑leverage channels and audiences
- Description: Target early adopters where they gather and pour effort into one or two channels that show clear traction before layering others.
- Source Books: Hacking Growth by Sean Ellis and Morgan Brown, Growth Hacker Marketing — Ryan Holiday
- Example: Facebook started by focusing narrowly on Harvard and then Ivy League campuses before broadening access—concentrating efforts where network effects would ignite. ([history.com](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/facebook-launches-mark-zuckerberg?utm_source=openai))

### FP13 — Audience truth > internal opinion
- Description: Use well-designed audience testing and rapid research to inform creative and product decisions; synthesize feedback quickly into prioritized fixes; let paying audiences validate direction.
- Source Books: Audience-Ology by Kevin Goetz
- Example: Google’s culture famously tested even “41 shades of blue” to choose link colors, privileging user response over internal taste in UI decisions. ([wired.com](https://www.wired.com/2009/03/googles-data-cu/?utm_source=openai))

### FP14 — Creativity serves sales and experience
- Description: Judge creative by its ability to sell without taxing user experience; when you find a winner, keep it running and iterate rather than changing for taste alone.
- Source Books: Ogilvy on Advertising by David Ogilvy, Click Here by Alex Schultz
- Example: Apple’s long‑running “Get a Mac” campaign correlated with sizable sales lifts shortly after launch, so the company kept iterating on the winning creative over multiple years. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac?utm_source=openai))

### FP15 — Write to think and align teams
- Description: Use writing (press releases, FAQs, narrative memos, clear copy) to force clarity, anticipate objections, and align product, marketing, and operations around the customer’s job‑to‑be‑done.
- Source Books: Everybody Writes — Ann Handley, Growth Hacker Marketing — Ryan Holiday
- Example: Amazon bans slide decks in favor of six‑page narrative memos and PR/FAQ docs; meetings start with silent reading to create shared context and sharper decisions. ([a16z.com](https://a16z.com/podcast/amazon-narratives-memos-working-backwards-from-release-more/?utm_source=openai))

### FP16 — Respect cognitive load: simplify and guide
- Description: Confusion and overwhelm kill action. Present the next best step, reduce choices and effort early, and teach what to do and what to believe to sustain momentum.
- Source Books: Retention Point by Robert Skrob, Hacking Growth by Sean Ellis and Morgan Brown, Everybody Writes — Ann Handley
- Example: Stripe reports businesses moving to its optimized Checkout/Payment Element saw an average 10.5% revenue uplift, reflecting many small simplifications that reduce friction and guidance gaps. ([stripe.com](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/payments-revenue-uplift?utm_source=openai))

### FP17 — Operational integrity of data is non‑negotiable

### FP18 — Invest with discipline: back winners, cut losers, and budget exploration
- Description: Concentrate spend on proven performers (channels, offers, products), stop what doesn’t work, and protect a fixed exploration budget to keep discovering new growth.
- Source Books: Ogilvy on Advertising by David Ogilvy, Hacking Growth by Sean Ellis and Morgan Brown, Converted by Neil Hoyne
